# Public list of assets listed in xBull Wallet

This repository includes all assets that are "pre-defined" into the wallet for easier use.

The lists are divided into different categories:

- Curated by Creit Tech: This is a list of assets which are popular in the network and which we (either by looking in the network or thanks to their creators) have curated so people don't get confused and get the wrong ones (copycat coins).
- Alert labels by Creit Tech: This is a list of domains we have identified as risky or just simple scams.

## Do you want to edit the list?
Open a new ticket in this repo, so we can check your asset and confirm if it should be or not in our list. Depending on the list type you will need to meet certain criteria:

### Curated list
The curated list **does not imply we trust your token**, it's just a list so the legitimate creator can make stuff easier for their users, so they don't get the wrong one. If you are trying to list your token these are the requirements it needs to meet:

- You must be the issuer.
- Your asset is at least 7 months old.
- Your asset issuer must have set up a domain with a valid .toml file with the description of the asset and the issuer (will be published here).
- Your asset must have at least 20 trust lines which are at least 2-months-old, and they were added at least 3 months after the first distribution of the asset.
- If your asset was rejected before, you need to wait at least a month before trying again. Doing it so before that period of time will increase the timeout x3.

Note: This list of requirements could change at any moment, and we could remove your asset from our list without notice if we believe is needed. Keep in mind that the process is public and won't be removed after a ticket has been closed.
